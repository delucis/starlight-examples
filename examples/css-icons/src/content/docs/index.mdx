title: Adding icons to UI with CSS
description: How to use some custom CSS to add an icon to Starlight’s UI
---

import css from '../../styles.css?raw';
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This example demonstrates adding some custom CSS to add an icon to the table of contents “on this page” heading.

This approach uses the [`mask-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image) CSS property to add an icon which uses one of Starlight’s colour variables and the technique can also be applied to other parts of the UI if desired.

## Added styles

<Code code={css} lang="css" title="src/styles.css" />
