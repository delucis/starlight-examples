  tagline: This example demonstrates setting a custom link in the site title.
---

This example shows how to use [route middleware](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/#customizing-route-data) to set the link in the site title to point somewhere different from where your docs are hosted.

In `astro.config.mjs` the `site` value should point to where the docs themselves are hosted:

```js
site: 'https://docs.example.com',
```

The route middleware at `src/routeMiddleware.ts` overrides this, so that the site title link points to `example.com` instead.
