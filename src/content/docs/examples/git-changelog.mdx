title: Generate a changelog with Git
description: A custom page that renders a list of changes to the current repo using Git

import StackBlitz from '../../../components/StackBlitz.astro';

This example demonstrates a custom page, which uses Git to generate a list of changes for the current repo.

:::note

This example does not work on StackBlitz as Git is not available in the browser environment.

To test it, download the project, initialize Git, and make some commits.

:::

<StackBlitz
	projectId="github-wscelw"
	options={{
		openFile: 'src/pages/docs-changes.astro',
		showSidebar: true,
		clickToLoad: true,
	}}
/>
