import StackBlitz from '../../../components/StackBlitz.astro';

This example demonstrates a custom `<Include>` component, which renders Markdown content from the `src/includes/` directory.

<StackBlitz
	projectId="github-ugnnlj"
	options={{
		openFile:
			'src/includes/one.md,src/includes/two.md,src/content/docs/index.mdx,src/components/Include.astro',
		showSidebar: true,
	}}
/>
