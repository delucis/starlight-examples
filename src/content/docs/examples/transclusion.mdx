This example demonstrates a custom `<Include>` component, which renders Markdown content from the `src/includes/` directory.

<StackBlitz
	title="Starlight - Transclusion example"
	example="transclusion"
	openFile="src/includes/one.md,src/includes/two.md,src/content/docs/index.mdx,src/components/Include.astro"
	showSidebar
/>
