title: Edit in editor button
description: An override that replaces the default edit link with a button to edit the current page in your editor

import StackBlitz from "../../../components/StackBlitz.astro";

This example demonstrates a custom [`<EditLink>` component override](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#editlink) that replaces the default edit link with a button to edit the current page in your editor while in development mode.

This feature relies on the [`launch-editor-middleware`](https://github.com/yyx990803/launch-editor#middleware) exposed by Vite.

<StackBlitz
  projectId="github-mydczx"
  options={{
    openFile: "astro.config.mjs,src/components/EditInEditor.astro",
  }}
/>
