description: Take full control over page rendering by overriding Starlight’s Page component

import StackBlitz from '../../../components/StackBlitz.astro';

This example demonstrates using Vite’s `resolve.alias` config to override Starlight’s top-level page template.

Overriding the page component is not officially supported and will require a lot of work to reimplement features, but is an option if you want to use Starlight for routing and i18n, but take full control of the page layout.

<StackBlitz
	projectId="github-ixrwlq"
	options={{
		openFile: 'src/PageOverride.astro,astro.config.mjs',
	}}
/>
